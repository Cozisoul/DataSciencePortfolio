# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing (Regression Challenge)

## Overview
This project involved a regression analysis of the Kaggle Mercedes-Benz dataset. The goal was to predict vehicle testing times based on features, optimizing the manufacturing process and identifying efficiency improvements.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- scikit-learn (PCA, StandardScaler, model_selection)
- XGBoost (XGBRegressor)

## Skills Demonstrated
✅ **Feature Engineering:** Handled categorical variables using label encoding.  
✅ **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA to retain 95% variance while reducing feature space.  
✅ **Model Tuning:** Used RandomizedSearchCV to tune XGBoost hyperparameters for improved accuracy.  
✅ **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated with MAE and 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Learnings
- Applying regression models to real-world efficiency challenges.
- Managing high-dimensional datasets with mixed variable types.
- Building a robust workflow from cleaning to feature reduction, tuning, and prediction.
