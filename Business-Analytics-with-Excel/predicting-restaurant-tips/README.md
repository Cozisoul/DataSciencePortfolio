# Sales Dashboard in Excel

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an interactive sales dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard enables dynamic analysis of e-commerce sales data across different product categories, regions, and time periods, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.

- **Features:** Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Aging, Ship Mode, Product Category, Product, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping Cost, Order Priority, Customer ID, Customer Name, City, State, Country, Region, Months

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized date formats.
- Data preparation: Extracted month from order dates, calculated profit margins.
- Pivot tables: Summarized sales and profit by month and region.
- User controls: Implemented a combo box for filtering by product category.
- Visualization: Created column charts for monthly and regional trends.
- Dashboard: Integrated all elements into a single, user-friendly dashboard sheet.

## Key Learnings
- Mastered advanced Excel features such as pivot tables, form controls, and dynamic charting.
- Learned the importance of clean, well-structured data for accurate reporting.
- Developed skills in designing dashboards that are both informative and easy to use.
- Understood how interactivity (e.g., combo boxes) enhances user-driven analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional visualizations (such as maps or scatter plots).
- Automate report generation with macros.
- Connect the dashboard to live data sources for real-time analytics.
