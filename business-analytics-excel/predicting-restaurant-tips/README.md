# Predicting Restaurant Tips Using Excel Analytics

## Overview
This project applies predictive analytics techniques in Excel to estimate restaurant tips based on customer and transaction attributes. It covers the full workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation, showcasing Excel's capabilities for statistical modeling and business insight.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Restaurant tips dataset.xlsx
- **Features:** sex, smoker, day, time, size, total bill, tip

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning: Identified and removed missing values and duplicates.
- Feature engineering: Encoded categorical variables numerically (e.g., gender, smoker status, day, time).
- Correlation analysis: Explored relationships between predictors and tip amount.
- Regression modeling: Built linear regression models to predict tip amounts.
- Model evaluation: Calculated RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to assess prediction accuracy.
- Documentation: Compared actual vs. predicted tips and summarized findings.

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end predictive modeling process in Excel.
- Learned to encode categorical data and analyze feature correlations.
- Practiced building and interpreting regression models without programming.
- Discovered the value of error metrics like RMSE for evaluating model performance.
- Recognized Excelâ€™s strengths and limitations for business-focused predictive analytics.

## Future Improvements
- Explore non-linear or multi-variable regression models for better accuracy.
- Automate the encoding and prediction process with macros.
- Visualize prediction errors and residuals for deeper diagnostic insight.
- Integrate external data (e.g., weather, holidays) to enrich the model.
- Compare Excel-based results with those from Python/R for validation.
